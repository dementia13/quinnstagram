## Notes

Began with stretch features because I couldn't stand the way the bare-bones app looked. 
This means that I ran out of time to get user sign-up working. I had difficulty getting the two toolbars to display diffently.
I wanted to have logout on a separate screen selected by the user button on the bottom toolbar, but I couldn't get that button working.
